# Face Recognition 
To prevent the use of digital identities for criminal purposes, facial recognition has become a widespread tool in many countries. The demand for facial recognition software is increasing every year, with the market expecting to grow by $7.7 billion by 2022, and a large portion of its current use is to identify and authenticate users.

## What is Face Recognition?
Many people are becoming increasingly familiar with facial recognition technology due to unlocking features in new phones requiring face ID. In this use case, facial recognition is used to determine that the individual is the owner of the device and authorize access to the phone.

Facial recognition is a technology that can match a human face from a digital image or video, against a database of stored faces. Facial recognition generally uses biometrics to help identify facial features. This type of identification is helpful for various commercial and law enforcement applications. When it comes to digital authentication, facial recognition falls under the category of biometrics.

## Facial Biometrics: How It Works
Biometrics are biological measurements or physical features that are used to identify individuals. Some common forms of biometrics include fingerprint mapping, retina scans, and facial biometrics. Facial biometrics works through:
-Face Detection: The camera detects and locates a face individually or present in a crowd
-Face Analysis: The image of the face is captured and analyzed. Most variants of facial biometric technology tend to rely on 2D images rather than 3D images. The software finds the geometry of an individual’s face, like the distance between their eyes, distance from forehead to chin, etc. Facial landmarks are identified to make it easier to distinguish a face in a database and a real live person.
-Converting the Image: The captured face image (analog information) is transformed into a set of digital information (data) depending on an individual’s facial features. The numerical code is known as a faceprint. Each individual has a unique faceprint, also known as Biometric Templates.
-Finding the match: A unique faceprint is compared to a database of other known faceprints. A correct match has been made if the unique faceprint is matched to a known one in the database. More recently Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have become the emerging technologies used in Face Recognition. A.I. models are trained with image recognition algorithms and training sets to be able to match faces with different poses and different lighting conditions. These models are usually based on Deep Learning and [ Convolutional Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)

Compared to other types of biometric recognition, facial recognition is considered the most natural form of matching, because that is how humans can actually determine how one person can differentiate from another: by comparing facial features. When compared with other forms of biometric screenings, Face Recognition has the best User Experience. To recognize fingerprints. hand palms or a person’s iris, some part of the human body need to be purposely scanned by a special sensor. In order to implement face recognition, just a simple selfie of the user is needed.

## The Purpose of Face Recognition Technology

The main objective of facial recognition is to identify individuals, whether individually or collectively. The number of false positives can vary, depending on the technology used for facial recognition. The best face identification algorithm has an error rate of 0.08%. Facial recognition systems that operate with liveness detection, have higher rates of accuracy.

There are various benefits of facial recognition, depending on the industry and application. It can be a convenient, safe, and hassle-free method to identify a person at a distance without any physical contact. Facial recognition, when used correctly, has led to increased security functions, decreased instances of crime, faster processing, and greater convenience for the public. There are however concerns about the introduction of bias into systems that rely on facial recognition. Most recently Facebook announced that it is stopping the use of facial recognition to recognize people on its platform.
